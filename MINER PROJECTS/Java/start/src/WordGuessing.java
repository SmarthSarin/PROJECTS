/*Write a Java program for a two-player word guessing game, 
The game should begin by asking the first player to enter their name and a word for the second player to guess. 
Then, the second player should input their name, receive a welcome message, 
and start guessing the word letter by letter. The game should allow up to 10 incorrect guesses. 
Additionally, a 10-minute timer should be implemented, with a message displaying the remaining time every minute. 
If the player makes 10 incorrect guesses or the 10 minutes expire, they lose the game.‚Äù Also after every win or lose, 
you will switch the sides, for other player to play. */
